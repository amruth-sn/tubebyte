# TubeByte

TubeByte is a free YouTube-to-MP3 converter service I made for my own needs. Often times, I find myself struggling to find a song or remix I like within a music streaming 
app such as Spotify, Soundcloud, or Apple Music. Luckily, some of these streaming services offer user-based local .mp3 files to be added to an individual's playlist. Based on 
this, I wanted to find a simple, trustworthy method in which I could find an audio or song I enjoyed listening to on YouTube that I could efficiently add to my playlists.

In short, I came up with creating this safe converter that I could trust to consistently output readable, good quality (128kbps) audio files of YouTube videos, that I could
then add to my streaming services' local files. Feel free to use this converter in any way you wish.

Thanks again,
