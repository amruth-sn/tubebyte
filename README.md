# TubeByte

TubeByte is a free YouTube-to-MP3 converter service I made for my own needs. Often times, I find myself struggling to find a song or remix I like within a music streaming 
app such as Spotify, Soundcloud, or Apple Music. Luckily, some of these streaming services offer user-based local .mp3 files to be added to an individual's playlist. Based on 
this, I wanted to find a simple, trustworthy method in which I could find an audio or song I enjoyed listening to on YouTube that I could efficiently add to my playlists.

In short, I came up with creating this safe converter that I could trust to consistently output readable, good quality (128kbps) audio files of YouTube videos, that I could
then add to my streaming services' local files. Feel free to use this converter in any way you wish.

## Download Page
Some may complain that the Download page is riddled with ads, looks untrustworthy, etc. I can wholeheartedly assure you that the site is completely safe as long as you 
follow the simple procedure of **only** engaging with the blue 'Download' button. I am not liable for any malware or advertisements that appear if you click anywhere 
else. After clicking the 'Download' button, your browser may ask you if you would like to trust the site, to which the answer should be 'Yes' if you would like to download
your .mp3 file. After downloading, which should not take more than a few seconds depending on your Internet speed, please close out of the Download page.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy! Let me know if there are any bugs I need to fix at amruthsniranjan@gmail.com. Also, the first download link on the home page takes a bit longer than 
the rest, and this is due to the free subscription I am using with Render (the backend hosting service). Please stay patient and do not worry, you will be able to 
download your link!

Thanks again,
Amruth Niranjan
